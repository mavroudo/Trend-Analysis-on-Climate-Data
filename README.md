## Trend Analysis on Climate Data
Comparing climate models is challenging as the resolution and the coordinate system doesnt oftenly match. We have created a Python script that can read large volume of data from several models and preprocess them to create datasets that are comarable. Trend analysis is performed on top of these datasets in order to compare the predicted temperature for Budabest until the end of the century. Additionally, using historical data from the same area we train a Recursive Neural Network to perform the same task, i.e. predicting the upcoming temperatures. The comparison demonstrates that RNN shows that are overly optimistic since it is unable to accurately account for the human aspect.Comparing climate models is challenging as the resolution and the coordinate system doesnt oftenly match.
